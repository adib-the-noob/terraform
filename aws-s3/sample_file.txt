Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and store data, applications, and computing resources over the internet instead of on local computers or servers. This service model enables businesses and individuals to use powerful computing capabilities on-demand without needing to invest in expensive hardware or infrastructure. Popular cloud services include storage solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox, as well as comprehensive platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The main benefits of cloud computing include cost savings, scalability, accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection, and automatic software updates managed by the service provider.
